Work for the Lumate Challenge

The files contained in this repo are meant for the Lumate challenge.

This small project creates a very (VERY) simple website that includes a 
homepage. On the homepage is a guestbook form that a visitor can type 
their first and last name. When submitted the fields are stored in a 
postgresql database and a link appears allowing the visitor to see the 
guestbook (which hopefully contains many signatures of previous visitors 
to the website)

The main packages used in the development of this project are python and 
Django. Djanjo models are used to set up the classes for the database and 
views were made to display the webpages to visitors and to create new 
entries in the database. The database used is PostgreSQL.

The project is tested to work on an Ubuntu instance.
